# EezPass

EezPass is a really personalisable random password generator

### Importation

  To import **EezPass**, you just have put the *eezpass.py* file in the same folder as your code file.<br>

  After you have checked that, use the **from ... import ...** command by adding the following line on top of your code :
  ```py
  from eezpass import *
  ```

  By doing this, Python will automatically add the *__pycache__* folder into your code folder like shown on the image.

***

### Basic configuration
  
First, you need to create an instance of the *EezPass class* with this code :
```py
<instance_name> = EezPass(<admin_password>)
```
The admin password is used to make modifications to the parameters.<br>
  For more readability, we will use <em>myPass</em> as <instance_name> further in the code<br><br>

After that, you just have to set a few parameters before starting using the password generator :
- The charsets you will use (a = lower letters, m = upper letters, n = numbers, s = special characters)
- The password's length
With the following code :
```py
myPass.set_charsets('<charsets>')
myPass.set_length(<password_length>)
```
An example for <charsets> could be 'amn' for all letters and numbers

These are the necessaries options.

### Advanced configuration
Now, let's take a look at the unnecessaries options, but who gives you interesting features.

- Passwords logs<br>
    This feature allow you to create a file that will contain all the passwords generated by EezPass using the following code 
    ```py
    myPass.enable_password_logs(True)
    ```
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99663083/169659129-f6c3055c-dadc-4c70-a4e2-b42b24e03085.png)<br>
    You can also disable the logs (they are disabled by default) just by using False instead of True as argument<br>
    If you want to change the file name (by default passwords.log), then use this command
    ```py
    myPass.passwordLogs = '<new_name>'
    ```

- Global logs<br>
    While passwords logs allow you to find your generated passwords easily, global logs allow you to see every action performed by your code.<br>
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99663083/169659011-615b3c08-93d6-4dcf-90c4-0004630a74cc.png)<br>
    You can enable them like that :
    ```py
    myPass.enable_logs(True)
    ```
    And just as passwords logs, they are also disabled by default but you can if necessary you can disable them by using False instead of True.<br>
    You can also change the logs file name, who is <em>default.log</em>
    ```py
    myPass.logs = '<new_name>'
    ```

- Include string<br>
    This is probably the hardest thing to understand about this code, the string including allows you to insert the string you want in your password and at a chosen or random position (by default it is 0).<br>
    You can configure that with these few commands :
    ```py
    myPass.include_string(True)
    myPass.set_include_string_position(<string_include_position>)
    ```
    And when you will run your code, it will ask you for the string you want to include.<br>
    For the <string_include_position>, you can use a number or the * character (this will generate a random number).<br>
    If you do not want to include a string anymore while you are running your code, just press enter without answering.

### Addtionnal features
They are a few functions that are not explained up to now. So let's show these additionnal features :
- Print properties<br>
You can print the password's properties (charsets and length) with this command :
```py
myPass.print_properties()
```

- Print generated password(s)
You can print one or all the generated passwords with their index :
```py
myPass.print_passlogs(<index>)
```
The index can be a number or '*'. In that case, it will print all the generated passwords

- End the programm<br>
There is a function called *end()* who is called at the end of the programm 
```py
end()
```
***
  
### Code example
For this example I will use this code :
```py
from eezpass import * # Import the eezpass module

os.system('cls') # Clear the console

myPass = EezPass('admin') # Create a new instance of EezPass

myPass.enable_logs(True) # Enable general logs
myPass.enable_password_logs(True) # Enable password logs
myPass.set_charsets('amns') # Select all charsets
myPass.set_length(16) # Set the password length to 16 characters

myPass.include_string(True) # Enable string including
myPass.set_include_string_position('*') # Set it to a random position

myPass.print_properties() # Print properties
myPass.print_password() # Print the final password
myPass.print_passlogs('*') # Print all generated passwords
```

As you can see, we have configured that with the following process :
- Use'admin' as admin password (which is not really a good choice)<br><br>
- Enable logs
- Enable password logs<br><br>
- Select lower letters, upper letters, numbers and special characters as charsets
- Set the password's length to 16 characters<br><br>
- Enable the string inclusion
- Set the string included's position to random<br><br>
- Print the properties
- Print the final password
- Print all generated passwords

And this will produce the following output :
```
What is the password ? admin
Which string do you want to include ? EezPass
Password length :  16
Enabled charsets :  Lower letters, upper letters, numbers, special characters
Y9jWht^DgEezPass

Y9jWht^DgEezPass
```

Now, if we rerun the same code, we get this output :
```
What is the password ? admin
Which string do you want to include ? EezPass
Password length :  16
Enabled charsets :  Lower letters, upper letters, numbers, special characters
E4]n*ZgO}EezPass

Y9jWht^DgEezPass
E4]n*ZgO}EezPass
```

If you open the logs file, you will get something very similar to this :
```log
LOGS ENABLED at [2022-05-21 21:36:46.422301]
Password logs enabled set to True
Logged as ADMIN
Include string turned to True with the string 'EezPass'
Properties printed
Password generated : 'Y9jWht^DgEezPass'
Password printed
Success [] (Programm exited successfully)
LOGS ENABLED at [2022-05-21 21:37:13.842654]
Password logs enabled set to True
Logged as ADMIN
Include string turned to True with the string 'EezPass'
Properties printed
Password generated : 'E4]n*ZgO}EezPass'
Password printed
Success [] (Programm exited successfully)
```
